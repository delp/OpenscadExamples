Made this for holding some lumber while building a planter.

20% infill was too little and this was brittle and broke when I was using it.
Luckily only partially though, and it was still able to hold the wood effectively.

The inner "post" doesn't need to come up to the same height as the outer wall. Just a tiny rise 1cm height appears to be good.
